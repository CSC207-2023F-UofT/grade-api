# Sign up

The API to sign up a "UTORid" (username) for this system.

Note:
1. Even though we call it "UTORid", you don't have to sign up with your real UTORid.
You can use any ids you want, if not taken by someone else already.
2. You need to copy and paste the returned token immediately.
The token will only be shown once. If you forget the token, you need to sign up with
a different id.
